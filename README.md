# Stocks_Analysis-
## Overview 
This Project was designed as an analysis of the stock DAQO in order top determine it's worthiness as an investment for our client. We aimed to see how the stock performed in relation to other companies of it's kind. We analyzed all the stocks in the years 2017, and 2018 in order to determine which stocks have had the best returns. We also aimed to be sure that our code would run efficiently and without issues when analyzing a large set of data.  
###Results
What we found out through our analysis of DAQO is that it in fact underperformed in regards to other stocks of it's type and so thus we had other options available to us that would give a better ROI.  What we know by the numbers is that DAQO in the year 2018 had a total daily trading volume of 107873900, and had returns of -62.6%. In regards to the twelve stocks we ran DAQO actaully had the lowest ROI. It was on the lower end of the spectrum in traded daily volume. Stocks like 'ENPH' and 'RUN' had much higher daily trading volumes and ROIs, at (607473500, +81.9%) and (502757100,+84%) respectively. ![Screenshot (42)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93295751/141720313-cf8074e0-e677-4d18-af0f-9aa3a98377ec.png)
###Summary
Overall I had many challenges in refactoring the code in order to get this module to run correctly. My biggest issue was finding the right syntax for my code. I had trouble figuring out how to successfully get all my arrays to loop using the proper index. I believe I lack the necessary knowledge to understand the formatting required to get the code to run right. I will defintiely need more practice and knowledge to get my VBA skills up to par in order to successfully run a project of this type on my own.
